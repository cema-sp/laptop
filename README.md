Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a macOS laptop for web and mobile development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)
* macOS High Sierra (10.13)
* macOS Mojave (10.14)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested.
Bug reports for older versions are welcome.

Install
-------

1. Log into iTunes, iCloud, App Store
2. Install XCode dev tools: `xcode-select --install`
2. Download the script:

```sh
curl -LOk https://github.com/cema-sp/laptop/archive/master.zip
```

Review the script (avoid running scripts you haven't read!):

```sh
unzip -a master.zip
cd ./laptop-master
less mac
```

Execute the downloaded script:

```sh
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ./laptop.log
```

Optionally, review the log:

```sh
less ~/laptop.log
```
